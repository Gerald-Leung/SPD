\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\pagestyle{CVfooter}

In this short document, we summarise the process of
the Scottish Postcode Directory (SPD) file checks from the
National Records of Scotland (NRS) by the Geospatial Team at
Public Health Scotland (PHS). In short, NRS updates
SPD files twice a year, around March and September\footnote{\url{https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/geography/nrs-postcode-extract}}. The Geospatial Team
will then conduct quality checks of the updated files
and compare any changes with the previous version.
They will then produce lookup files in various
formats, such as \texttt{.csv}. This
document focuses on summarising the processes of quality
checking (QC)
and lookup files production using \R.
Here we also reproduce a brief summary
of the data, which can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:dict}.
Full details can be found through the \href{https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/geography/2021-2/spd-datadictionary-2021-2.pdf}{data dictionary} provided by the NRS,
or accessed through
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/1_Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory/Source Data/2021_2
/ISD Data Dictionary_2021-2
\end{lstlisting}
for the \textbf{2021-2} version.

\section{Initial Quality Checks}
The \R scripts are located in 
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/5_GitHub/GPD/Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory
\end{lstlisting}
and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are located in
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/1_Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory/SOPs.
\end{lstlisting}
The source files can be found in
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/1_Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory/Source Data.
\end{lstlisting}
They can be accessed through the organisation's VPN.
The first QC is done through the \R script \texttt{1\_Check NRS SPD.R}.

In short, this script conducts a general initial
QC of the newest version of SPD files and compares
changes with the previous version. Figure \ref{fig:block1}
shows roughly the structure of the script and the QC process.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Schematic diagram of the initial QC process.}\label{fig:block1}
\end{figure}

To start with, all empty rows contained in the files
are removed and the files are combined. The user will then
record the total number of records and postcode types (\texttt{Large User} or \texttt{Small User}).
Sanity checks are conducted to make sure there are
no blank entries for Health Board and Council Areas.
The script then checks for postcodes that moved
from Glasgow City Council to North Lanarkshire Council
(eight in total).
Checks are then carried out to make sure columns are
aligned correctly. For example, between Health Board Area
Code and Council Area Code columns to make sure their values in 1995 (e.g. \texttt{HealthBoardArea1995Code}) represent the same area in 2006 (e.g. \texttt{HealthBoardArea2006Code}). This is generally done
by assigning a number to the case when a particular
column does not have an expected code that should match
with the other column. For instance:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R,frame=single]
HB_issue = case_when(HealthBoardArea1995Code == '01' & 
                              HealthBoardArea2006Code != 'S08000008' ~ 1)
Count(HB_issue)
\end{lstlisting} 
Refer to Appendix \ref{appendix:dict} or the NRS
data dictionary mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro}
for more information of the data.
 
 Extensive checks are then carried
out to make sure there are no blank fields, through the \texttt{checks} function

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R,frame=single]
checks <- function(variable1, variable2){
  
  spd %>% 
    mutate(check = case_when(variable1 == "" & variable2 != "" ~ 1, 
                             variable1 != "" & variable2 == "" ~ 2)) %>% 
    count(check) %>% 
    print()
  
}
\end{lstlisting}
So for instance, we should expect that
if \texttt{OutputArea2001Code} is blank, then\\
\texttt{DataZone2001Code} should also be blank since
the data zones are made up of output areas. Throughout
the script, blank fields are also checked by, for example,

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
spd %>% summarise(missing = sum(is.na(DataZone2001Code)))
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{spd} refers to the \texttt{SingleRecord.csv}
data frame.


Examinations are also
carried out to make sure there are no English voting codes included. Some checks are also carried to make sure
there are no errors with postcodes and their
split indicators.
Finally, the script makes sure that mappings are done correctly,
such as Data Zones and Health Boards.

The script also makes comparisons with previous SPD files.
For instance,it checks for changes in postcodes
(some have been deleted), different data zones and
health boards etc.

 
\section{Lookup Files}
The next step of the process is to produce lookup files for
other uses and analysis within the organisation. This is done through the \texttt{2\_Create Postcode Lookup Files.R} script. Figure \ref{fig:block2} shows an overview of the process. To begin
with, all the variables are renamed and changed into
correct format. The Urban Rural codes are changed into
named columns. Some formatting are done to ensure
consistency with \R and \spss. For instance, by adding
leading zeros to some columns and making sure
blank cells are represented as \texttt{NA}. The script
then connects to the PHS Open Data website\footnote{\url{https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/}}   
to access Geography Codes and Names data file,
which are then used for column names, including
Data Zone, Intermediate Zone, Council Area,
Health and Social Care Partnership and Health Board.
These are then merged with the original
\texttt{SingleRecord.csv} to produce the lookup file.

\draw[->] (A) -- (B);
\draw[->] (B) -- (B2);


\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Schematic diagram of the lookup file production process.}\label{fig:block2}
\end{figure}

\section{Updating Postcode Table}
After QC, the data needs to be uploaded to the
corporate data warehouse (CDW). The lookup files are found in
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/1_Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory/Lookup Files.
\end{lstlisting} 
The tables from
the previous SPD files have to be updated to satisfy
any requirements from the IT. Some columns
are not required and therefore removed. On the other hand,
there are columns that are no longer supplied by the NRS.
They are however still required for CDW and therefore
must be added here. The columns are renamed and finally
reordered, and saved as
\begin{lstlisting}
//PHIBCS/PHI/Referencing & Standards/GPD/1_Geography
/Scottish Postcode Directory/Lookup Files
/Scottish_Postcode_Directory_2021-2_CDW.csv
\end{lstlisting} 
for the \textbf{2021-2} version.

\section{Testing Postcode Table}
The file is then uploaded to APXU by IT,
which requires testing. This is done with the script
\texttt{5\_Check Postcode table on MGSREF APXU}.
We start off by connecting to the APXU and access
the database there.
